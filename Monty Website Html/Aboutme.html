        <h3>Favorite Subject </h3>

        <p>My favorite subject in school is Science. I really like chemistry; of which I took my sophomore year. My junior year (right now) I am taking physics. I plan to take ap chemistry my senior year. I'd say to some extent I like mathematics and history. It just depends on the field of study for each class. </p>

        <i>My point of view for Providence High School </i>

        <p>This is my junior year, everybody expects a lot from me; brings a lot of pressure. But with the help of Providence, they can help me soothe the pressure and use it with motivation. </p>
