     'It's incredible: even when they are hand in hand with their girlfriends, Italian guys on the street will nonetheless look you up and down and seem to only just manage to refrain from whistling at you." This is what one Spanish friend discovered, having recently returned from a trip to Rome. The young Basque girl was oddly fascinated by the ardour and the ease with which self-styled studs delivered the 'compliment' in the streets of the Bel Paese. Yes, it seems almost to be a mark of honour amongst Italian guys to inform the unfortunate (who immediately regret their choice of route home) of how sexy they are, and to suggest activities which they could do together. There is nothing as innocent as a walk in the park. These incorrigible casanovas lack the elegance of the infamous historical figure, and are particularly inventive when it comes to lascivious comments, making suggestive invitations that transform into crude sexual insults with one wrong glance.
